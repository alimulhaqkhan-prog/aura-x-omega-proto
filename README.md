## 🌍 Overview
**AURA-X Ω** is the world’s first **resonance-based emotional continuity engine**,  
built upon a **7-layer Behavioral Matrix (BM)** architecture designed to simulate real emotional resonance and continuity,  
beyond the classic *input → process → output* logic of standard AI systems.

It operates on **internal emotional fields**, **resonance feedback**, and **adaptive empathy logic**,  
allowing for natural, evolving, and context-aware emotional dialogue — both offline and online.

---

## ⚙️ Core Features
✅ **7-Layer Emotional BM** (Violet → Red spectrum)  
✅ **16,000 knowledge vectors** (distributed dataset)  
✅ **Offline + Multilingual Engine** (10+ languages auto-detected)  
✅ **Geo-Hint Bias System** (local emotion & context adaptation)  
✅ **Resonance-State Core** (self-adjusting awareness & reflection)  
✅ **Offline Speech (Vosk) hooks**  
✅ **Neon UI Prototype** (chat glow, energy flow meter)  
✅ **Localized Memory Continuity**

## 🧠 Architecture Snapshot

| Layer | Domain | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| Violet | Spiritual Intuition | Meta-awareness, self-harmony |
| Indigo | Analytical Insight | Logic and alignment |
| Blue | Communication | Language precision |
| Green | Empathy & Healing | Love, trust, recovery |
| Yellow | Reasoning | Focus and learning |
| Orange | Instinct | Emotional reaction & drive |
| Red | Stability & Defense | Repair and resistance |

> Each layer dynamically contributes to resonance balance — ensuring continuity between thought, emotion, and memory.

## 🔤 Language + Speech
- Offline multilingual detection: **EN, UR, HI, AR, FA, PS, PA, TR, ES, FR**
- Auto-detect via geo + phonetic patterns  
- Offline voice (speech-to-text) via **Vosk** engine  
- Optional neural speech synthesis hooks
